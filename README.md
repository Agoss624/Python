# Python
README:
I've been keeping track of 14 datapoints over the past 2 years around the games I play.  This final project is the start of my game log program that I will be using to track and manage my gaming history.  I will be uploading/saving my current log as well as adding as I go. The future patches are planned to go live in Q4 2024.

When adding a new game to the log, www.howlongtobeat.com will launch with the game you are adding in order to gather the needed information should you not know it. 


Purpose Statement:
The "GameLog" Python program is designed to streamline users' gaming management experience. It facilitates the tracking of gaming progress, habit insights, and maintenance of a thorough game library. With features for adding, updating, and removing games from a personal log, users can efficiently manage their gaming activity. Integration with external resources empowers users to easily fetch additional game information, ensuring the log's accuracy and relevance. Primary purpose is to promote effective gaming history management.



Future patches / Roadmap:
- Platform & Genre selection expansion
- Notes section segmented by date
- Automatic website integration for stats and info
- Personal rating system
- Trophy progression
- Cost & Price/Time Spent analysis
